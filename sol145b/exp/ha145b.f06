   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions.
  
     -  The purpose of this release is to sync MSC Nastran 2018.1
        with Patran 2018.0 release for improved compatibility
  
     Dynamics
     -  Structural and Fluid Material property specification can now be
        frequency dependent.
     -  Anisotropic structural damping can be defined for composite
        materials. Restriction removed that damping is proportional to
        stiffness.
     -  Spatial definition of property and material available now.
  
     Linear Buckling
     -  Linear Buckling with local exclusion of differential stiffness in SOL
        105.
  
     Rotordynamics
     -  Enhanced Mode-Tracking for Campbell Diagrams. Two new methods
1       introduced: Numerical Slope-Continuity and Eigenvector-Based.
     -  Rotors can now be included in upstream Part Superelements for
        both single and multi-level assemblies.
     -  Support for definition of CBUSH element cross-coupling terms.
  
     Multiple-Mass Configuration
     -  Easy definition and analysis of multiple mass cases in a single run.
        Supported in SOL 101, 103, 107/110, 108/111, 109/112, 144, 145, 146,
        200 and 400 solution sequences.
  
     Optimization
     -  Shell stress constraints can now be defined for Topology Optimization.
  
     Assembly
     -  New modules that can assemble multiple Bulk Data sections to form a
        single MSC Nastran input file. Modules are analogous to part
        superelements without reduction and are supported in SOL 101 - 112.
  
     Implicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 400
     -  GPFORCE Output with Contact
     -  Automatic Contact Generation
     -  External Superelements Creation, Assembly and Data Recovery
     -  CFAST Fastener element enabled to FUSE based on load criteria.
  
     Explicit Nonlinear Analysis - SOL 700
     -  Automated Coupling Surfaces
     -  New SOL 700 Dytran, Dytran under Nastran
  
     HPC
     -  Improved performance and scalability for the New ACMS method
     -  New MPYAD with better parallel performance and better method
        selection.
     -  New command line option, solve=auto and cpumax=N, to automatically
        choose optimal solver and parallel options based on hardware and
        the model.
  
     Results HDF5 Database
     -  Additional data blocks have been added to the HDF5 file: OEFTGV,
        OMONPNT, TOMVAR, TOPVAR, R1TABRD, HISADD, RESP12, WETFACES, META,
        OFCRFM, EPTFSP, MPTFSP, TRNUORD, and UHT, as well as modal and
        Rotordynamic matrices.
  
     Documentation
  
     The complete documentation set is provided in a separate installer and
     when installed is available at:
     MSC_DOC_DIR/doc/pdf_nastran directory.
     Where MSC_DOC_DIR is the directory where documentation was installed
     This help set has cross references between documents, links to how-to
     videos, and example files.
