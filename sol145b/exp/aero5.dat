$        THE CAERO1 ENTRY IS USED FOR DOUBLET-LATTICE AERODYNAMICS.     $
$        LISTED ARE ITS PAERO ENTRY ID AND THE COORDINATE SYSTEM        $
$        FOR LOCATING THE INBOARD AND OUTBOARD LEADING EDGE POINTS      $
$        (1 AND 4).  NSPAN AND NCHORD, OR LSPAN AND LCHORD, ARE         $
$        USED TO PARTITION THE WING INTO AERODYNAMIC BOXES, THE         $
$        FORMER FOR UNIFORMLY SPACED BOXES AND THE LATTER FOR           $
$        NON-UNIFORMLY SPACED BOXES.  IGID IS THE ID OF ITS             $
$        ASSOCIATED INTERFERENCE GROUP.  THE CONTINUATION ENTRY         $
$        DEFINES POINTS 1 AND 2, THE ROOT CHORD AND THE TIP CHORD.      $
$        THE BOXES FORMED BY THE GRID LINES WILL BE NUMBERED            $
$        BEGINNING WITH EID, SO A NUMBER SHOULD BE CHOSEN THAT IS       $
$        UNIQUE, AND IS GREATER THAN ALL STRUCTURAL GRID, SCALAR        $
